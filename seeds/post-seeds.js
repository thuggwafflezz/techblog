When I play Nocturne it always happens to me that when I want to ganke and I want to see the range of my R to see if it is in range, I put the cursor over the R on the skill bar to see the range and it is very annoying, if I hold down the R it activates and I don't want that, because it may not be in range and I run out of R. So I ask, is there any way to see the range of the R of Nocturne without having to put the cursor over the R skill bar?",
